The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first.</p> <p>But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills - and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit - he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?</p> <p>Wil Wheaton, who has lent his voice to sci-fi blockbusters like <i>Ready Player One</i> and <i>Redshirts</i>, breathes new life (and plenty of sarcasm) into the iconic character of Mark Watney, making this edition a must-listen for both longtime fans of The Martian and new listeners alike.</p> <p><b>BONUS MATERIAL: This edition includes the following extras:</b></p> <p></p> <ul> <li>“Diary of an AssCan” - Mark Watney, new astronaut</li> <li>“I Made It!” - A happy letter to Mom</li> <li>“Car Trouble” - A somewhat sad letter to Mom</li> <li>“The Earthling” - A postscript.<b> *Available for the first time in this recording&nbsp;</b></li> </ul>","title":"The Martian","titleShort":"The Martian"},{"added":91,"asin":"B074NBTRGL","authors":[{"name":"Pierce Brown","url":"B00EDBZVNI"}],"blurb":"Ten years after the events of Morning Star, Darrow and the Rising are battling the remaining Gold loyalist forces....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"51jVpI9h-jL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"23h 23m","narrators":[{"name":"Tim Gerard Reynolds"},{"name":"John Curless"},{"name":"Julian Elfer"},{"name":"Aedin Moloney"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B019NMZ6FE","authors":"Pierce Brown","cover":"51z6+j-wj-L","length":"21 hrs and 50 mins","narrators":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","subHeading":"Book III of the Red Rising Trilogy","title":"Morning Star"},{"asin":"B00R6S1RCY","authors":"Pierce Brown","cover":"51doOF0+6iL","length":"19 hrs and 3 mins","narrators":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","subHeading":"Book II of the Red Rising Trilogy","title":"Golden Son"},{"asin":"B07TZKT8WS","authors":"Michael J.

continues the immersive fantasy epic that </b><b><i>The Way of Kings</i></b><b> began.</b></p> <p>Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status \"darkeyes\". Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.</p> <p>The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin’s master has much deeper motives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.&nbsp;</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere</i></li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></li> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)</li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> <li><i>Collection</i></li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity </i></li> </ul>","title":"Words of Radiance: The Stormlight Archive, Book 2","titleShort":"Words of Radiance"},{"added":83,"asin":"B01E97TPPA","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Sansbury Smith","url":"B00BVNB3TC"}],"blurb":"More than two centuries after World War III poisoned the planet, the final bastion of humanity lives on massive airships circling the globe in search of a habitable area to call home.

The first book in the series is Mark Twain’s <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, performed by Elijah Wood. </p> <p>Ernest Hemingway said, “All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>\". One hundred years after its author’s death, this classic remains remarkably modern and poignantly relevant. In this brand new edition, Elijah Wood reads Huck in a youthful voice that may be the closest interpretation to Twain’s original intent. His performance captures the excitement and confusion of adolescence and adventure. Best of all, the immediacy of Wood’s energetic reading sweeps listeners up and makes them feel as though they’re along for the ride, as Huck and Jim push their raft toward freedom. </p> <p>Stay tuned for more one-of-a-kind performances from actors Kenneth Branagh, David Hyde Pierce, Leelee Sobieski, and more, only from Audible Signature Classics.</p>","title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: A Signature Performance by Elijah Wood","titleShort":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: A Signature Performance by Elijah Wood"},{"added":71,"asin":"B002UZL9G2","authors":[{"name":"Ayn Rand","url":"B000APYGIW"}],"blurb":"Tremendous in scope and breathtaking in its suspense, Atlas Shrugged is Ayn Rand's magnum opus, an electrifying moral defense of capitalism and free enterprise....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"cover":"51vWAJneFBL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"62h 56m ","narrators":[{"name":"Scott Brick"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V5A3TA","authors":"Ayn Rand","cover":"51PhQ89LalL","length":"32 hrs and 5 mins","narrators":"Christopher Hurt","title":"The Fountainhead"},{"asin":"B002V19RO6","authors":"George Orwell","cover":"612oBD9OSjL","length":"11 hrs and 22 mins","narrators":"Simon Prebble","subHeading":"New Classic Edition","title":"1984"},{"asin":"B002UZN280","authors":"Ayn Rand","cover":"51z-0kuyYGL","length":"14 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Anna Fields","subHeading":"The Unknown Ideal","title":"Capitalism"},{"asin":"B002V5H6F4","authors":"George Orwell","cover":"51Q-CnFS8pL","length":"3 hrs and 11 mins","narrators":"Ralph Cosham","title":"Animal Farm"},{"asin":"B002V1BVK4","authors":"Aldous Huxley","cover":"51gbhwoYYFL","length":"8 hrs","narrators":"Michael York","title":"Brave New World"},{"asin":"B002VA3J2S","authors":"Ayn Rand","cover":"515AJh3LszL","length":"6 hrs and 15 mins","narrators":"C.

But a frantic message from one of the Tree Folk indicating he and Alya may be in danger compels him to skip the lazy repose and travel to a far away ruin to speak with a possibly crazy Alka Alon mage - Lilastien, the Sorceress of Sartha Wood. After river pirates, trolls, and the sheer difficulty of adjusting to married life, the answers to the questions he has for her may be more than he, his wife, and his marriage can handle.</p> <p>Come sail down the languid Burine river with the Spellmonger, and see how seven bottles of mead and a pregnant bride can turn a holiday jaunt into a potential interspecies disaster!</p> <p>Note: This novella fits chronologically just before the events of <i>Magelord</i>, book three.</p>","title":"The Spellmonger's Honeymoon: A Spellmonger Novella: The Spellmonger Series, Book 2.5","titleShort":"The Spellmonger's Honeymoon: A Spellmonger Novella"},{"added":69,"asin":"B002V9ZF3K","authors":[{"name":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","url":"B000APYSC6"},{"name":"Constance Garnett - translator","url":"B000APTDDU"}],"blurb":"This is an intense detective thriller instilled with philosophical, religious, and social commentary....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"cover":"51ZSmls3ILL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"20h 28m","narrators":[{"name":"Anthony Heald"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B01FN88BHC","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","cover":"61ZRKnCssaL","length":"35 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","title":"Anna Karenina"},{"asin":"B002V0PVJC","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","cover":"51K-U7lZIvL","length":"61 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Frederick Davidson","title":"War and Peace"},{"asin":"B00EZAXAF8","authors":"Constance Garnett - translator, Fyodor Dostoevsky","cover":"51DpA-g11JL","length":"37 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"Constantine Gregory","title":"The Brothers Karamazov [Naxos AudioBooks Edition]"},{"asin":"B002V1BVK4","authors":"Aldous Huxley","cover":"51gbhwoYYFL","length":"8 hrs","narrators":"Michael York","title":"Brave New World"},{"asin":"B002V8H8V8","authors":"George Orwell","cover":"51R0fGBpnWL","length":"7 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Frederick Davidson","title":"The Road to Wigan Pier"},{"asin":"B002V19RO6","authors":"George Orwell","cover":"612oBD9OSjL","length":"11 hrs and 22 mins","narrators":"Simon Prebble","subHeading":"New Classic Edition","title":"1984"},{"asin":"B016LN23CC","authors":"Jane Austen","cover":"51y-ivhKErL","length":"11 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","title":"Pride and Prejudice"},{"asin":"B002VAEJ9U","authors":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","cover":"51ce83JIlYL","length":"4 hrs and 21 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","title":"Notes from the Underground"},{"asin":"B0078PA1OA","authors":"Bram Stoker","cover":"51ef+s6y42L","length":"15 hrs and 28 mins","narrators":"Alan Cumming, Tim Curry, Simon Vance, and others","title":"Dracula [Audible Edition]"},{"asin":"B002V8LAN0","authors":"Fyodor Dostoevsky, Constance Garnett - translator","cover":"518bAmMY-jL","length":"34 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Frederick Davidson","title":"The Brothers Karamazov"},{"asin":"B002V5H6F4","authors":"George Orwell","cover":"51Q-CnFS8pL","length":"3 hrs and 11 mins","narrators":"Ralph Cosham","title":"Animal Farm"},{"asin":"B01N5W7S18","authors":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","cover":"61kzROpNOIL","length":"24 hrs and 56 mins","narrators":"Constantine Gregory","title":"The Idiot"},{"asin":"B0064RB9VW","authors":"Anton Chekhov","cover":"51i+dgQEBvL","length":"7 hrs and 42 mins","narrators":"Anthony Heald","subHeading":"1882–1885","title":"The Complete Stories of Anton Chekhov, Vol. 1"},{"asin":"0593408519","authors":"Jordan B.

Tony believes that God wants every man to be a world changer. He skillfully takes listeners along a journey through the principles of biblical manhood, exploring how those who live, work, and minister around a kingdom man benefit from his leadership and care. Men will be challenged to fully understand their positions under God as well as their positions over what God has given them. Equipped with these concepts, they can actively pursue ways to maximize and develop the character qualities of biblical manhood in their lives. As Tony contends, the enemy doesn't want you to know it, but you're not the man you think you are. You're a whole lot more.

Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well.

A Nice Guy, according to Dr. Glover, is a man who believes he is not okay, just as he is. Due to both societal and familial conditioning, this man is convinced he must become what he thinks others want him to be in order to be liked, loved, and get his needs met. He also believes he must hide anything about himself that might trigger a negative response in others. This inauthentic and chameleon-like approach to life causes Nice Guys to feel frustrated, confused, and resentful. Subsequently, these men are often anything but nice.&nbsp;</p> <p>In fact, Nice Guys are generally:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Dishonest&nbsp;</li> <li>Secretive&nbsp;</li> <li>Manipulative&nbsp;</li> <li>Controlling&nbsp;</li> <li>Self-centered and narcissistic&nbsp;</li> <li>Passive-aggressive&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Common Nice Guy patterns include giving to get, difficulty setting boundaries, caretaking, fixing, people pleasing, avoiding conflict, unsatisfying relationships, and issues with sexuality, pornography, and compulsive masturbation. The paradigm of the Nice Guy Syndrome is driven by three faulty covert contracts:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>If I am good, then I will be liked and loved (and the women I want to have sex with will want to have sex with me).&nbsp;</li> <li>If I meet other people’s needs without them having to ask, then they will meet my needs without me having to ask.&nbsp;</li> <li>If I do everything right, then I will have a smooth, problem-free life.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <p>These covert contracts create a roadmap for life that rarely results in the Nice Guy getting what he really wants. Thankfully, there are answers.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> teaches men how to:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Set boundaries and handle conflict&nbsp;</li> <li>Live with purpose and passion&nbsp;</li> <li>Release toxic shame&nbsp;</li> <li>Soothe anxiety&nbsp;</li> <li>Differentiate from fused emotional systems&nbsp;</li> <li>Connect with men and build tribe&nbsp;</li> <li>Have satisfying relationships&nbsp;</li> <li>Experience great sex&nbsp;</li> <li>Live life on their terms&nbsp;</li> <li>Achieve success&nbsp;</li> <li>Live up their potential in work and career&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>This process allows the recovering Nice Guy to move through:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Depression&nbsp;</li> <li>Social anxiety and shyness&nbsp;</li> <li>Codependency&nbsp;</li> <li>Low self-esteem</li> <li>Loneliness and hopelessness&nbsp;</li> <li>Feelings of failure&nbsp;</li> <li>Lack of confidence and purpose&nbsp;</li> <li>Compulsive behaviors and addictions&nbsp;</li> <li>Feeling stuck in life&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Contrary to what the title might seem to imply, <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> does not teach men how to be not nice. In fact, Dr. Glover shows men how to become what he calls an Integrated Male. Becoming integrated doesn’t mean becoming different or better. It means being able to accept all aspects of one’s self. An integrated male is able to embrace everything that makes him unique: his power, his assertiveness, his humor, his courage, and his mission, as well as his imperfections, his mistakes, his rough edges, and his dark side. If you are single and are frequently told you are “too nice” and end up in the friend zone, if you are married and frustrated with conflicts or lack of sex, or if you are rotting in middle management in the workplace, this book is for you. If you are ready to get what you want in love, sex, and life, <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> will show you how. Dr. Glover holds a Ph.D. in marriage and family therapy and is committed to empowering men to achieve dating and relationship success.

For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible.

Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress - to measure what mattered.</p> <p>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (\"the greatest manager of his or any era\") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than 50 companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.</p> <p>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization.</p> <p>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.</p> <p>In <i>Measure What Matters</i>, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.</p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.</p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.</p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:</p> <p>Life before death.</p> <p>Strength before weakness.</p> <p>Journey before destination.</p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.</p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon

This is an easy \"Yes\". Eliza has always preferred Nana Mora's beach cottage on St. Simons Island to the apartment she and her mom call home in the city. The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them.

James portrays every character in a small Jersey Shore town as he unravels the story of Leonard Pelkey, a tenaciously optimistic and flamboyant 14-year-old boy who has gone missing. A luminous force of nature whose magic is only truly felt once he is gone, Leonard becomes an unexpected inspiration as the town’s citizens question how they live, who they love, and what they leave behind.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brash detective Chuck DeSantis seeks out answers as to why Leonard is missing. Along the way, questions about the teen’s sexuality force members of the community to confront their own biases and beliefs.

Try having one for a boss, or co-worker. That’s the predicament Andrea Vernon finds herself in as the heroine of Alexander C. Kane’s debut audiobook. Drowning in debt, and forced to move back into her parents’ Queens apartment, Andrea starts looking for a job. Luckily for her, she finds herself recruited—well, really kidnapped—by the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection (C.U.P.), an organization that deploys superheroes. Suddenly Andrea must contend with co-workers who can shoot lightning from their fingertips, face the imminent destruction of humanity, and juggle a fledgling romance with a giant lumberjack. It’s all in a day’s work for the would-be novelist turned superstar secretary.</p> <p>Audible Hall of Fame narrator Bahni Turpin is perfectly cast as a normal person finding herself in abnormal circumstances. Turpin brings to life an entire cast of quirky characters, along with their heroically funny antics in the cubicle next door.

In the vast Alaskan Arctic, legend has it there once lived a mythic tribe—Iñukuns—that only existed in rumors and whispers. This changed forever when an actor-turned-fugitive, Teddy Kyle Smith, had an encounter that brought Iñukuns from myth to reality. Smith was an aspiring actor with a promising career until it all came quickly crashing down with a gunshot, a manhunt, bloodshed, and other frightful events.</p> <p>The story of Smith’s tragic downfall has long haunted James Dommek, Jr., the great-grandson of the last of the Iñupiaq story-tellers. <i>Midnight Son</i> is his journey in discovering who Teddy Kyle Smith was, what he did, and what he really saw. Along the way, listeners will experience the soul of the real Alaska as narrator Dommek, Jr. brings this multilayered and sprawling tale to life.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please Note: Midnight Son contains adult language and violent themes.
