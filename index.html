was a simple rhyme, a honeymoon folk blessing from the Riverlands, Minalan's home.</p> <p><i>Seven bottles of mead to share.</i><br> <i> For seven nights or more.</i><br> <i> Each cup a toast, each sip a wish.</i><br> <i> To bind their lives forevermore:</i><br> <i> A bottle first for happiness, a bottle then for health.</i><br> <i> A bottle for togetherness, a bottle next for wealth.</i><br> <i> A bottle sipped for harmony, the equilibrium of desire.</i><br> <i> A bottle savored for purest lust, which brings the marriage fire!</i></p> <p><i>A bottle last for love to endure as long as life shall last,</i><br> <i> saved for they who toast their love when five full years have passed!</i></p> <p>But those seven bottles of mead were more than just a folk blessing. As Lord Minalan the Spellmonger began his honeymoon on a decadent river barge with his very pregnant bride, he had no idea that the occasion would have anything more complicated than eating, drinking, and making love on the agenda. But a frantic message from one of the Tree Folk indicating he and Alya may be in danger compels him to skip the lazy repose and travel to a far away ruin to speak with a possibly crazy Alka Alon mage - Lilastien, the Sorceress of Sartha Wood. After river pirates, trolls, and the sheer difficulty of adjusting to married life, the answers to the questions he has for her may be more than he, his wife, and his marriage can handle.</p> <p>Come sail down the languid Burine river with the Spellmonger, and see how seven bottles of mead and a pregnant bride can turn a holiday jaunt into a potential interspecies disaster!</p> <p>Note: This novella fits chronologically just before the events of <i>Magelord</i>, book three.</p>","title":"The Spellmonger's Honeymoon: A Spellmonger Novella: The Spellmonger Series, Book 2.5","titleShort":"The Spellmonger's Honeymoon: A Spellmonger Novella"},{"added":69,"asin":"B002V9ZF3K","authors":[{"name":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","url":"B000APYSC6"},{"name":"Constance Garnett (translator)","url":"/search"}],"blurb":"This is an intense detective thriller instilled with philosophical, religious, and social commentary....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"cover":"51ZSmls3ILL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"20h 28m","narrators":[{"name":"Anthony Heald"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V1LL8Q","authors":"William Faulkner","cover":"51KURrxGm0L","length":"8 hrs and 51 mins","narrators":"Grover Gardner","title":"The Sound and the Fury"},{"asin":"B01FN88BHC","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","cover":"61ZRKnCssaL","length":"35 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","title":"Anna Karenina"},{"asin":"B002V8L3RI","authors":"Herman Melville","cover":"61vJZteWBkL","length":"21 hrs and 19 mins","narrators":"Frank Muller","title":"Moby-Dick"},{"asin":"B002V0PVJC","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","cover":"51K-U7lZIvL","length":"61 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Frederick Davidson","title":"War and Peace"},{"asin":"B00EZAXAF8","authors":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Constance Garnett - translator","cover":"51DpA-g11JL","length":"37 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"Constantine Gregory","title":"The Brothers Karamazov [Naxos AudioBooks Edition]"},{"asin":"B005ZIMPJG","authors":"Charles Dickens","cover":"61f8oxmdSWL","length":"18 hrs and 32 mins","narrators":"Simon Prebble","title":"Great Expectations"},{"asin":"B002UZJF4U","authors":"Alexandre Dumas","cover":"6107JL9xNWL","length":"23 hrs and 32 mins","narrators":"John Lee","title":"The Three Musketeers"},{"asin":"B01BLVD5F8","authors":"Homer, Caroline Alexander - translator","cover":"418qp6gNQAL","length":"19 hrs and 46 mins","narrators":"Dominic Keating","subHeading":"A New Translation by Caroline Alexander","title":"The Iliad"},{"asin":"1799744698","authors":"Leo Tolstoy, Louise Maude - translator, Aylmer Maude - translator","cover":"41fiQBv7XSL","length":"55 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","title":"War and Peace (AmazonClassics Edition)"},{"asin":"B002V0RMBM","authors":"Albert Camus","cover":"41+yaXiBB7L","length":"3 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Jonathan Davis","title":"The Stranger"},{"asin":"B002V9Z6GG","authors":"John Milton","cover":"61lERqg0DoL","length":"9 hrs and 11 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","title":"Paradise Lost"},{"asin":"1914230078","authors":"George Orwell","cover":"41KBgZf2TuL","length":"7 hrs","narrators":"Jonathan Keeble","title":"The Road to Wigan Pier"},{"asin":"B00EF8DG68","authors":"Gabriel García Márquez, Gregory Rabassa - translator","cover":"51bu58-DHXL","length":"14 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"John Lee","title":"One Hundred Years of Solitude"},{"asin":"B01BVPPFFM","authors":"Paul Rosenzweig, The Great Courses","cover":"61daoRK8JcL","length":"12 hrs and 8 mins","narrators":"Paul Rosenzweig","subHeading":"Big Data, Freedom, and You","title":"The Surveillance State"},{"asin":"B002V5CW08","authors":"Daniel Defoe","cover":"51qBBzZYbVL","length":"10 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","title":"Robinson Crusoe"},{"asin":"B0044EOCA2","authors":"Alexis de Tocqueville","cover":"51flOhd1sTL","length":"34 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"John Pruden","title":"Democracy in America"},{"asin":"B00DDUVALC","authors":"Malcolm David Eckel, The Great Courses","cover":"51xCFRa980L","length":"12 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Malcolm David Eckel","title":"Buddhism"},{"asin":"B002V1BVK4","authors":"Aldous Huxley","cover":"51gbhwoYYFL","length":"8 hrs","narrators":"Michael York","title":"Brave New World"}],"progress":0,"publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"rating":4.5,"ratings":5229,"releaseDate":"2007-12-03","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/002442/bk_blak_002442_sample.mp3","series":null,"summary":"In this intense detective thriller instilled with philosophical, religious, and social commentary, Dostoevsky studies the psychological impact upon a desperate and impoverished student when he murders a despicable pawnbroker, transgressing moral law to ultimately \"benefit humanity\".","title":"Crime and Punishment","titleShort":"Crime and Punishment"},{"added":68,"asin":"B002V0QUOC","authors":[{"name":"Viktor E.

Tony believes that God wants every man to be a world changer. He skillfully takes listeners along a journey through the principles of biblical manhood, exploring how those who live, work, and minister around a kingdom man benefit from his leadership and care. Men will be challenged to fully understand their positions under God as well as their positions over what God has given them. Equipped with these concepts, they can actively pursue ways to maximize and develop the character qualities of biblical manhood in their lives. As Tony contends, the enemy doesn't want you to know it, but you're not the man you think you are. You're a whole lot more. Starting now, you can be a kingdom man. </p>","title":"Kingdom Man: Every Man's Destiny, Every Woman's Dream","titleShort":"Kingdom Man"},{"added":63,"asin":"B07M9ZJ9CY","authors":[{"name":"R. S.

Vin is consumed with guilt at having been tricked into releasing the mystic force known as Ruin from the Well.

A Nice Guy, according to Dr. Glover, is a man who believes he is not okay, just as he is. Due to both societal and familial conditioning, this man is convinced he must become what he thinks others want him to be in order to be liked, loved, and get his needs met. He also believes he must hide anything about himself that might trigger a negative response in others. This inauthentic and chameleon-like approach to life causes Nice Guys to feel frustrated, confused, and resentful. Subsequently, these men are often anything but nice.&nbsp;</p> <p>In fact, Nice Guys are generally:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Dishonest&nbsp;</li> <li>Secretive&nbsp;</li> <li>Manipulative&nbsp;</li> <li>Controlling&nbsp;</li> <li>Self-centered and narcissistic&nbsp;</li> <li>Passive-aggressive&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Common Nice Guy patterns include giving to get, difficulty setting boundaries, caretaking, fixing, people pleasing, avoiding conflict, unsatisfying relationships, and issues with sexuality, pornography, and compulsive masturbation. The paradigm of the Nice Guy Syndrome is driven by three faulty covert contracts:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>If I am good, then I will be liked and loved (and the women I want to have sex with will want to have sex with me).&nbsp;</li> <li>If I meet other people’s needs without them having to ask, then they will meet my needs without me having to ask.&nbsp;</li> <li>If I do everything right, then I will have a smooth, problem-free life.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <p>These covert contracts create a roadmap for life that rarely results in the Nice Guy getting what he really wants. Thankfully, there are answers.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> teaches men how to:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Set boundaries and handle conflict&nbsp;</li> <li>Live with purpose and passion&nbsp;</li> <li>Release toxic shame&nbsp;</li> <li>Soothe anxiety&nbsp;</li> <li>Differentiate from fused emotional systems&nbsp;</li> <li>Connect with men and build tribe&nbsp;</li> <li>Have satisfying relationships&nbsp;</li> <li>Experience great sex&nbsp;</li> <li>Live life on their terms&nbsp;</li> <li>Achieve success&nbsp;</li> <li>Live up their potential in work and career&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>This process allows the recovering Nice Guy to move through:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Depression&nbsp;</li> <li>Social anxiety and shyness&nbsp;</li> <li>Codependency&nbsp;</li> <li>Low self-esteem</li> <li>Loneliness and hopelessness&nbsp;</li> <li>Feelings of failure&nbsp;</li> <li>Lack of confidence and purpose&nbsp;</li> <li>Compulsive behaviors and addictions&nbsp;</li> <li>Feeling stuck in life&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Contrary to what the title might seem to imply, <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> does not teach men how to be not nice. In fact, Dr. Glover shows men how to become what he calls an Integrated Male. Becoming integrated doesn’t mean becoming different or better. It means being able to accept all aspects of one’s self. An integrated male is able to embrace everything that makes him unique: his power, his assertiveness, his humor, his courage, and his mission, as well as his imperfections, his mistakes, his rough edges, and his dark side. If you are single and are frequently told you are “too nice” and end up in the friend zone, if you are married and frustrated with conflicts or lack of sex, or if you are rotting in middle management in the workplace, this book is for you. If you are ready to get what you want in love, sex, and life, <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> will show you how.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress - to measure what mattered.</p> <p>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (\"the greatest manager of his or any era\") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than 50 companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.</p> <p>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization.</p> <p>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.</p> <p>In <i>Measure What Matters</i>, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. This book will help a new generation of leaders capture the same magic.</p> <p><i>Read by John Doerr, William Davidow, Brett Kopf, Jini Kim, Mike Lee, Atticus Tysen, Patti Stonesifer, Susan Wojcicki, Cristos Goodrow, Julia Collins, Alex Garden, Joseph Suzuki, Andrew Cole, Bono, and others&nbsp;</i></p>","title":"Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs","titleShort":"Measure What Matters"},{"added":49,"asin":"B003ZWFO7E","authors":[{"name":"Brandon Sanderson","url":"B001IGFHW6"}],"blurb":"In a war that makes no sense, ten armies fight separately against a single foe....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51WHDfG28fL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"45h 30m","narrators":[{"name":"Kate Reading"},{"name":"Michael Kramer"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00HWF0MHW","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"51FSLyhA5qL","length":"48 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Michael Kramer, Kate Reading","subHeading":"The Stormlight Archive, Book 2","title":"Words of Radiance"},{"asin":"B0718Z5K4C","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"517c9dDm+sL","length":"55 hrs and 5 mins","narrators":"Kate Reading, Michael Kramer","title":"Oathbringer"},{"asin":"1250759781","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"61SUJE6inQL","length":"57 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Kate Reading, Michael Kramer","subHeading":"Book Four of The Stormlight Archive","title":"Rhythm of War"},{"asin":"B07626B9D2","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"51cs21IHrnL","length":"6 hrs and 23 mins","narrators":"Kate Reading","subHeading":"From the Stormlight Archive","title":"Edgedancer"},{"asin":"B0189QQXRA","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"61WyKPg6t0L","length":"14 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Michael Kramer","title":"The Bands of Mourning"},{"asin":"B0036NHZ10","authors":"Robert Jordan","cover":"51Q5xbmQh1L","length":"29 hrs and 57 mins","narrators":"Kate Reading, Michael Kramer","subHeading":"Book One of The Wheel of Time","title":"The Eye of the World"},{"asin":"B015YEFH40","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"61RpktwNVML","length":"28 hrs and 42 mins","narrators":"Jack Garrett","subHeading":"Tenth Anniversary Special Edition","title":"Elantris"},{"asin":"B01K5Q6VWO","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"61WIovWdZOL","length":"22 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Michael Kramer, Kate Reading","title":"Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection"},{"asin":"B005ZUI3OA","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"51l-hThTyGL","length":"10 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Michael Kramer","subHeading":"A Mistborn Novel","title":"The Alloy of Law"},{"asin":"B014LLCT7A","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"61nOjvn2cYL","length":"12 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Michael Kramer","title":"Shadows of Self"},{"asin":"B07H7Q5D3M","authors":"Brandon Sanderson","cover":"5184kxKmovL","length":"15 hrs and 28 mins","narrators":"Suzy Jackson","title":"Skyward"},{"asin":"B00MOXI512","authors":"Patrick Rothfuss","cover":"6160gSPTzjL","length":"3 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Patrick Rothfuss","subHeading":"Kingkiller Chronicle, Book 2.5","title":"The Slow Regard of Silent Things"},{"asin":"B002V1OF70","authors":"Frank Herbert","cover":"51f3UPrSPSL","length":"21 hrs and 2 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick, Orlagh Cassidy, Euan Morton, and others","title":"Dune"},{"asin":"0593163389","authors":"Scott Lynch","cover":"51q+A0B7N9L","length":"22 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Michael Page","subHeading":"Gentleman Bastard, Book 1","title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora"},{"asin":"B009ABIN72","authors":"J.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.</p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.</p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.</p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:</p> <p>Life before death.</p> <p>Strength before weakness.</p> <p>Journey before destination.</p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.</p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon

The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale.

Try having one for a boss, or co-worker. That’s the predicament Andrea Vernon finds herself in as the heroine of Alexander C. Kane’s debut audiobook. Drowning in debt, and forced to move back into her parents’ Queens apartment, Andrea starts looking for a job. Luckily for her, she finds herself recruited—well, really kidnapped—by the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection (C.U.P.), an organization that deploys superheroes. Suddenly Andrea must contend with co-workers who can shoot lightning from their fingertips, face the imminent destruction of humanity, and juggle a fledgling romance with a giant lumberjack. It’s all in a day’s work for the would-be novelist turned superstar secretary.</p> <p>Audible Hall of Fame narrator Bahni Turpin is perfectly cast as a normal person finding herself in abnormal circumstances. Turpin brings to life an entire cast of quirky characters, along with their heroically funny antics in the cubicle next door.
